We tried to implement Least Frequently Used and Least Recently Used algorithms on small scale in C++.
This repository includes two C++ files as well as a presentation that clearly illustrates the project as a whole.
We attempted to compare these algorithms' efficacies based on cache hits and cache misses.
The presentation explains our results and makes an effort to clarify some additional, practically useful information that we came across.
